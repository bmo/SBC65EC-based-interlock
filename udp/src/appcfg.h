 * @ingroup mod_conf
 * The application configuration is stored in the PIC microcontroller's internal
 * EEPROM in the first 256 bytes of data. The structure of the data is defined
 * in the @ref APP_CONFIG_ENUM enumeration.<br>
 * The device's default configuration is set in the eeconfigArray[] array in the
 * appcfg.c file. This array will define the values for the entire APP_CONFIG_ENUM, which
 * contains all application configuration. At compilation this data is added to the hex
 * file, which is then written to the PIC's internal EEPROM at programming. Some
 * programmers will have the options during programming not to program the PIC's internal
 * EEPROM memory. It is important to enable the programming of the internal EEPROM to
 * have this default device configuration written to the EEPROM.
