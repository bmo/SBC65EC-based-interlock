@defgroup mod_examples_udp UDP Server 1
@ingroup  mod_examples

This example is contained in "./udp/src/main_udp1.c"

This example program shows how to receive UDP datagrams. This program
acts as the server, and listens for any data entering on UDP port 54123.
If a UDP message is received, we set the system LED if the first byte of
the received message '1', and clear the system LED if it is '0'

For testing this example, the free Netix Network utility program (see
www.modtronix.com/soft/netix) can be used. This program has a UDP terminal
that can be used for sending and receiving UDP Datagrams.

The following modules are included in this project:
- ARP
- ICMP
- IP
- UDP
